## Upgrade your tours to full user journeys


To take your tours further and have more informed experiences, you can unlock event tracking with a Pro account. After signing up at [https://shepherdpro.com](https://shepherdpro.com), you will take your API key to initialize and connect events to your account.

First, you'll need to install the Pro package:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
  ```bash 
  npm install @shepherdpro/pro-js --save 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```bash 
  yarn add @shepherdpro/pro-js 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
  ```bash 
  pnpm add @shepherdpro/pro-js 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
  ```bash 
  bun add @shepherdpro/pro-js 
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


Before you create a new `Tour` instance, add your key via the `init` method:

```javascript
import Shepherd from '@shepherdpro/pro-js';

Shepherd.init({YOUR API KEY});

const journey = new Shepherd.Tour({
  ...
});
```

The second thing needed is to create an instance in the Pro portal, which will give you an ID to add to the tour.

```javascript
const journey = new Shepherd.Tour({
  id: 'custom-123',
  defaultStepOptions: {
    cancelIcon: {
      enabled: true
    },
    classes: 'my-custom-class'
  },
  useModalOverlay: true
});
```

Then you just need to add steps to the journey instance and trigger the start method to begin. Shepherd Pro will take care of the rest and capture events in the portal.
