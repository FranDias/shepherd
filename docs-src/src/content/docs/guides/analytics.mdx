With Shepherd, you can track the progress of your users through your journey. This can be useful for understanding how users are interacting with your site, and where they might be getting stuck. 

## Tracking
Events occur at each step of the journey, and can be tracked using the `on` event handler. Automatically, Shepherd Pro will track the following events: `active`, `cancel`, `complete`, `show`.

### Active
This event triggers when the tour itself becomes active. This means that the tour is ready and not necessarily that the first step is shown.

### Cancel
At any point, if the user cancels the tour, this event will trigger.

### Complete
When the user completes the tour, this event will trigger. This means that the user has gone through all the steps in the tour.

### Show
This event triggers when a step is shown to the user.


## Viewing Analytics
This will then be shown within the Pro portal under the Journey tab. Here you can see the number of times each Journey has been shown, and the number of times it has either been completed or cancelled.

## Integrations
Shepherd Pro integrates with Amplitude and Posthog (with more to come). This allows you to track your Shepherd events alongside your other analytics data to get a more complete picture of interactions with your users.
